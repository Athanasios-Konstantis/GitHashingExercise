The aim of this excercise is to create a script that receives a 4-digit integer as input and outputs the hash of
the input. For this purpose, we chose to use Fish shell to create and run the script. We also chose the hash
algorithm "SHA-256".

Instructions on how to use the script:

Go inside fish shell and type "fish hash_script <your_4_digit_number_here>"

The output should be a long string of random characters, but it should be the same for the same input

Also, notice how for small changes in input, the output changes dramatically. This is the feature of a good
hashing algorithm!
